# APB-based-SPI-Protocol
This project implements an APB-based SPI protocol, where the APB interface configures and controls the SPI core. The CPU programs registers to initiate data transfer, and the SPI master communicates with peripherals via MOSI, MISO, SCLK, and SS. Status and interrupt signals ensure reliable and efficient data exchange.
